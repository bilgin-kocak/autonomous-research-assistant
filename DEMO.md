## Demo Flow (5 minutes)

### **Introduction (30 seconds)**

**Script:**
> "Welcome to ScienceDAO - the world's first fully autonomous AI research platform. Our system uses multi-agent AI to conduct scientific research 24/7, identify knowledge gaps, generate novel hypotheses, and enable decentralized community funding. Let me show you how it works."

### **Part 1: Full Autonomous Research Demo (3-4 minutes)**

**Action:** Run the REAL agent demo script

```bash
npm run demo
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** This runs the **actual AI agents with real API calls**!
- Expected runtime: 2-5 minutes
- Makes real calls to: arXiv, OpenAI GPT-4, GAME SDK, ACP
- Writes real data to research_log.json
- This is NOT a simulation!

**What to highlight:**

1. **Paper Fetching from arXiv (15-30 seconds)**
   - "Watch as the agent fetches REAL papers from arXiv on machine learning research"
   - Point out: 3 actual papers with real titles and authors
   - "These are live ML/AI papers published in the last few months"

2. **AI Analysis with GPT-4 (60-90 seconds)**
   - "Now GPT-4 is analyzing each paper to extract findings and identify gaps"
   - Point out: Real-time analysis progress for each paper
   - "Watch the research gaps being identified - these are generated by AI"

3. **Hypothesis Generation (10-20 seconds)**
   - "The agent synthesizes findings across all papers to generate a novel hypothesis"
   - Read the generated hypothesis aloud - it's unique every time!
   - "This hypothesis was just created based on real research gaps"

4. **Peer Review via ACP (20-30 seconds)**
   - "Now the Peer Review Agent evaluates this hypothesis using GPT-4"
   - Point out the real scores: Novelty, Feasibility, Impact, Rigor
   - "These scores are generated by AI evaluation, not hardcoded"

5. **Data Curation via ACP (20-30 seconds)**
   - "The Data Curator Agent searches for relevant datasets"
   - Point out: Real dataset names from Kaggle, UCI ML, PubMed
   - "The agent actually searched these sources"

6. **Results in Dashboard**
   - "All of this data is now in research_log.json"
   - "Refresh the dashboard to see the new hypothesis with real scores"

**Key Message:**
> "What you just saw was the complete autonomous research pipeline in action - fetching real papers, analyzing them with GPT-4, generating novel hypotheses, peer reviewing them, and finding datasets. Every step used real AI, not fake data. This is the actual system that would run 24/7 in production."

### **Part 2: Dashboard Walkthrough (2 minutes)**

**Action:** Open http://localhost:5173

**Walkthrough:**

1. **Dashboard Tab** (30s)
   - Show metric cards: Papers Analyzed, Hypotheses Generated, etc.
   - Show real-time charts
   - "Everything updates every 5 seconds in real-time"

2. **Hypotheses Tab** (30s)
   - Click on Hypotheses tab
   - Expand a hypothesis
   - Point out peer review scores, strengths, weaknesses
   - "Each hypothesis includes AI-powered peer review feedback"

3. **Papers Tab** (15s)
   - Click on Papers tab
   - Show analyzed papers with findings and gaps
   - "All research is transparent and auditable"

4. **Agents Tab** (15s)
   - Click on Agents tab
   - Show multi-agent coordination stats
   - "Three specialized agents working together via ACP"

### **Part 3: Wallet Integration & Funding (1.5 minutes)**

**Action:** Connect wallet and fund a hypothesis

1. **Connect Wallet** (30s)
   - Click "Connect Wallet" in header
   - Choose Privy wallet or MetaMask
   - Show connected address

   **Script:**
   > "We use Privy for seamless wallet integration. Users can connect with MetaMask or create an embedded wallet instantly."

2. **Fund Hypothesis** (45s)
   - Go back to Hypotheses tab
   - Expand an approved hypothesis
   - Click "Fund 0.0001 ETH" button
   - Wait for transaction to process
   - Show success message

   **Script:**
   > "Community members can fund promising hypotheses with just one click. The transaction goes directly to our smart contract on Base Sepolia."

3. **View on BaseScan** (15s)
   - Click "View on BaseScan" link
   - Show transaction on explorer
   - Scroll to footer, show contract address
   - Click "View on BaseScan" in footer

   **Script:**
   > "Every transaction is transparent and verifiable on-chain. Here's our smart contract verified on BaseScan."

### **Conclusion (30 seconds)**

**Script:**
> "So to recap: ScienceDAO uses three AI agents - a Research Agent, Peer Review Agent, and Data Curator - that coordinate via Agent Commerce Protocol to autonomously conduct research, validate hypotheses, and enable community funding. All running 24/7 on Base blockchain with complete transparency."

**Call to Action:**
> "This solves the 'Valley of Death' problem in research funding - where promising ideas die because they can't get grants fast enough. With ScienceDAO, funding happens in minutes, not months."

## Troubleshooting

### API Server Won't Start

**Issue:** Port 3001 already in use

**Solution:**
```bash
# Find and kill process on port 3001
lsof -ti:3001 | xargs kill -9

# Restart API
cd api && npm start
```

### Frontend Build Errors

**Issue:** Node version mismatch

**Solution:**
```bash
# Switch to Node v22
nvm use 22

# Clear cache and reinstall
cd frontend
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Wallet Connection Fails

**Issue:** Privy not loading

**Solutions:**
1. Check that `VITE_PRIVY_APP_ID` is set in `frontend/.env`
2. Clear browser cache
3. Try in incognito mode
4. Check browser console for errors

### Transaction Fails

**Issue:** Insufficient funds or network error

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure you have Base Sepolia ETH ([Get from faucet](https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/base-sepolia))
2. Check you're on Base Sepolia network (Chain ID: 84532)
3. Verify contract address is correct
4. Check BaseScan for transaction status

### Demo Script Crashes

**Issue:** Missing dependencies or TypeScript errors

**Solution:**
```bash
# Reinstall dependencies
npm install

# Compile TypeScript
npm run build

# Run demo
npm run demo
```
