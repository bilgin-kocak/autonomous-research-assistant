## 🎯 **PRESENTATION TIPS**

### If Presenting Live (5 minutes)
```
Slide 1 (60 sec):
"Research funding is broken. It takes 18 months to get a grant,
and 80% of promising ideas die in the Valley of Death. We're
literally slowing down human progress."

Slide 2 (60 sec):
"We built autonomous AI agents that conduct research 24/7.
They fetch papers, generate hypotheses, get peer reviewed by
other agents, and create blockchain funding proposals - all
autonomously. Days instead of years."

Slide 3 (90 sec):
"Here's how it works. Research Agent coordinates with Peer
Review and Data Curator agents via Virtuals Protocol's ACP.
Approved hypotheses automatically create on-chain proposals
on Base. Everything is transparent and verifiable."

Slide 4 (90 sec):
"These are real results. 26 papers analyzed, 15 hypotheses
generated, 2 on-chain proposals. 100% peer reviewed with
7.8/10 average score. You can verify this right now on BaseScan
- contract address on screen."

Slide 5 (60 sec):
"DeSci is a $500M market growing 300% yearly. We're first in
Virtuals. Our go-to-market: partner with Bio Protocol and VitaDAO.
We already have a working system deployed on Base. This isn't
just a hackathon project - it's the foundation for accelerating
human discovery. Join us."
```

### Key Delivery Points
- **Energy:** High energy for slides 2 and 5, serious for slide 1
- **Pace:** Slower on slide 3 (technical), faster on slides 2 and 5
- **Emphasis:** Pause after big numbers, let them sink in
- **Interaction:** Point to elements on slides as you mention them
- **Confidence:** You have a working product - show it!
