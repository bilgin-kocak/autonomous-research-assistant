## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Test Hypothesis Generation
```bash
npm run test:hypothesis
```
**Expected output:**
- Generates 3 hypotheses for "longevity"
- Generates 3 hypotheses for "aging"
- Displays all scores (novelty, feasibility, impact, rigor)
- Ranks hypotheses by overall score
- Filters hypotheses by minimum threshold

### Test Complete Research Agent
```bash
npm run test:agent
```
**Expected output:**
- Fetches 3 papers from arXiv on "longevity"
- Analyzes all papers for findings and gaps
- Aggregates research gaps
- Generates 3 novel hypotheses
- Displays top hypothesis
- Shows complete statistics

### Run All Tests
```bash
npm run test:all
```
**Runs:** fetch → analyze → hypothesis → agent tests

### Run Autonomous Agent
```bash
npm start
```
**Note:** The agent requires proper GAME SDK integration. This will initialize the agent and allow it to run autonomously.

## 📊 Key Features & Capabilities

## 📝 Example Output

### Hypothesis Generation Example:
```json
{
  "hypothesis": "If senolytic drugs are combined with NAD+ precursor supplementation in a synergistic protocol, then the clearance of senescent cells will be enhanced by 40% compared to either intervention alone, because NAD+ restoration improves mitochondrial function in non-senescent cells while senolytics eliminate damaged cells.",
  "rationale": "Current research shows limited efficacy of single interventions...",
  "methodology": "Phase 1: In vitro validation using human fibroblast cultures...",
  "expected_impact": "Could provide first evidence for combination therapy...",
  "novelty_score": 9,
  "feasibility_score": 8,
  "impact_score": 9,
  "rigor_score": 8,
  "overall_score": 8.5
}
```
